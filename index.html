    <h1>hello Every one</h1>
    <h3>home task of//lesson_1</h3>
    <div id="container">
        <p>1==> because green plants are considerd AutoTrophs<br>
            then they convert <h3>(low_Energy and inorganic and simple subs. into high_Energy and organic and complex subs.)</h3>
            then the correct choice is <br><br><br>
            <mark>C</mark>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
        </p>
        <p>2==> Due to thier type of nutrietion<br> 
                then they must obtain thier energy in form of high_Energy and organic and complex subs.<br>
                thus(A&&B)Are Away <br>
                and letter (D) is Away also because they are not heterotrophes especially <h2>(parasites)..</h2> <br>
            
            then the correct choice is <br><br><br>
            <mark>c</mark>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>3==> any cell containes proptoplasm and sapvacule also cell membrane<br>
            but roothair is more spechialized (why??)<br>
           <h3> because it has large sap vacule and thin cell membrane and thin proptoplasm due to swelling up by the zone of elongation to increase its serfause area also its eficciency at absorping water </h3><br>

            
            then the correct choice is <br><br><br>
            <mark>d</mark>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
        </p>
        <p>4==> <h3>
            te best root hair which has largest serfauce area and thin cell wall to allow passage of water easily to sap vacule<br></h3>
            and all theese factors are available in choose (b)
            then the correct choice is (2 or b they are the same)<br><br><br></p>
            <mark>b</mark><br><br><hr>
        <p>5==> <h3>
            <h2>all of thes casses facilitate water to pass <span style="font-size: 40px;">except</span>presence of mitochonderia</h2>
            then the right choose is <br><br><br>
            <mark>b</mark><br><br><hr>
